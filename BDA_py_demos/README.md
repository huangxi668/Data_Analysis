# Bayesian Data Analysis Python Demos
[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org/repo/avehtari/BDA_py_demos) to interactively run the IPython Notebooks in the browser.

This repository contains some Python demos for the book [Bayesian Data
Analysis, 3rd ed by Gelman, Carlin, Stern, Dunson, Vehtari, and Rubin (BDA3)](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/).

Currently there are demos for BDA3 Chapters 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10 and 11. Furthermore there is a demo for [PyStan](https://github.com/stan-dev/pystan).

All demos have also notebook versions (.ipynb). When these are viewed
in github, the pre-generated figures are directly shown without need
to install anything.

The demos were originally written for Matlab by [Aki
Vehtari](http://users.aalto.fi/~ave/) and translated to Python by
[Tuomas Sivula](https://github.com/tsivula).

The corresponding [R demos](https://github.com/avehtari/BDA_R_demos) and [Matlab/Octave demos](https://github.com/avehtari/BDA_m_demos)
